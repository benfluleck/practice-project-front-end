# A Complete Intro to React

Welcome to a complete intro to React! The starter project is originally from Brian Holt from his frontend masters course for React found [here][gh-page]. I have pulled the bare bones project and followed along while modifying some of the features as I have coded along. The original project was done with *React Router v3*
